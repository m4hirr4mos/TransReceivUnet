#Using of Scripts
1 .Clone both the scripts into the Lyra directory after successfully and building and testing  of Lyra. Then open seperate terminals to run the receiver and transmitter scripts. 
2. In these scripts, the data is sent as a whole from the transmitter end to the receiver end . When the receiving data is too big (the recording is longer than 5 seconds) the receiver terminal does not display anything but when the recording is short and the transmitter data is small enough, successful decoding happens only for a small second .
